# gulp4beginner
A short and simple way to learn a little about Gulp!

Steps
-----

- Make you sure that your "nodejs" is installed typing `$ npm --version` and check if it will output the current version;
- Type `$ npm install --global gulp` to install and use Gulp globally;
- Type `$ npm install` to install all node modules that we will use;
- Type `$ gulp watch ` or just `$ gulp ` in the root of project to start the party;
- Change any files in "src/js" or "src/scss" and see files uglified, concated and in real time you can see if "js" files contain errors at changing and saving actions.
